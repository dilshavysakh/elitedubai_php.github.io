                        <p>The current generation Mercedes V-Class came at the beginning of 2014. More elegant and dynamic than its predecessor Viano, it was developed keeping in mind needs of three customer groups: families that have children that value active family life and leisure time, people with an active lifestyle that have many sports and outdoor equipment, and luxurious VIP or hotel shuttle buses.</p>

                        <p>More premium, more technology and more capable than ever - that’s how the Next Generation 2021 GMC Yukon signals a first-class experience even before you sit behind the wheel.The GMC Yukon is a good large SUV. It has powerful V8 engines and a cushioned ride, and it gets decent gas mileage for the class. Inside, there's plenty of space for adults in all three rows, and few competitors have as much cargo room – and that's before we even mention the long-wheelbase Yukon XL. There's a user-friendly infotainment system as well. Although, some class rivals are more engaging to drive.</p>

                        <p>The S450 may be the cheapest model in the range but it is still worthy of the S-Class name. It’s leather upholstery, 64-color ambient lighting, 16-way power-adjustable front seats, and power rear sunshade are all wonderful features that are supplemented by two 12.3-inch displays for driver info and media. Soft-close doors, an electronic trunk closer, wireless charging, and navigation are all included from the factory. Dual-zone climate control is standard too, as is voice control, satellite radio, and smartphone integration.</p>

                        <p>The BMW 7 Series Sedan impresses from the very first moment with its exceptional presence. The self-assured character is primarily underlined by the distinctive front. In the side, the vertical Air Breather emphasizes the height of the vehicle. The interplay between the paint finish in Bernina Grey with shimmering amber effect creates an elegance that, when combined with the 20" wheels, delivers a statement of commanding dynamics. A greeting from the Welcome and Goodbye light staging beckons before you even enter your BMW. The interior welcomes you with exclusive, high-quality materials which, together with the innovative connectivity features, produce a hitherto unachieved ambience.</p>

                        <p>The new Lexus ES has made a strong come back. With its longer and wider stance and that edgy styling, it looks like a million bucks and grabs eyeballs even in the company of more expensive cars. Also, the updated interior is cutting-edge and feels distinctive, so does the hybrid powertrain. Sadly, it doesn’t drive as sharp as it looks, lacking the outright punch and eager handling of its rivals.</p>
